      <p>Hi, I am Lesedi.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An avid reader of books, Formula 1 fanatic, Messi fanboy, and I am really sad Lewis Hamilton is getting old.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have a deep appreciation for the skill known as coding. Long have I
        dreamed of being able to write software and now I can.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition to writing code, I{" "}
        <span className="text-primary font-bold">WRITE</span> a lot about
        anything and everything. When I am not eating or sleeping, I am on my
        desk writing, reading, listening or thinking of what to do next.
